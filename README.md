# Zoom_Automation
Bored of clicking links one after the other, copy all links and let computer do it for you

The code basically opens the zoom id links and also can be used for google meet, basically 
it is a for loop inside a while loop just opening the links as the starttime is equal to the given time(by the user).

NOTE: The time should be in the 24hr format and check the data.py file for reference, an example is given, the user just 
      has to edit it / cutomise it according to his/her ease.

The x.py is the Main File the code is in it , run the x.py after you change the data.py according to your schedule.

The code will constantly run in the background and open the links according to the time give.
